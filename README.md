Distribution Shape: Does your histogram show a long tail? What percentage of requests fall into the "slow" category? <br>
  Most bars on the left (fast responses) (99.9%)<br>
  Long tail extending right (slow outliers)<br>
  Calculate: How many requests > 500ms? (4 requests over total 123 requests)<br>
Consistency: Are the response times consistent throughout the 30-second window, or do you see patterns or spikes?<br>
  Itâ€™s consistent.<br>
Percentiles: What's the difference between your median (50th percentile) and 95th percentile response times? A large gap indicates high variability.<br>
  146.44ms vs 99th percentile: 5107.03ms
